With no extra variables, there's a straightforward method of encoding
the rules of Life: for each of the 2^9 = 512 configurations of
dead/alive for every 3x3 region, encode what the successor is with a
single clause.

This can be optimized slightly.

The successor is alive if exactly three of the neighbors is alive OR if
the center is alive and exactly two of the neighbors.  This can be
encoded with (9 choose 3) = 84 clauses.

(For each of the 3-subsets of all 9 things: if the subset includes the
center, encode the full (9+1)-term clause; else, exclude the center for
a (8+1)-term clause.)


The successor is dead if at least four of the neighbors are alive or if
at most two of the neighbors and itself are alive (equivalently, at
least seven of the neighbors and itself are dead).  This can be encoded
with (8 choose 4) + (9 choose 2) = 70 + 36 = 106 clauses.


Together it takes 190 clauses.
