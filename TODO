Immediate goals:

* Check in test/data/.
* Write a grid-wise inverter.
* Run grid-wise inverter on the test set.


"Optimal" deterministic reasoning:

Write a bunch of helper routines for dealing with SAT solvers, letting a
library take care of things like remembering the variables/clauses,
calling the solver, interpreting the output, and such.

One higher-level routine then can accept a SAT problem and return
possible values for all of the variables, ie which are forced to be true
or false.

Then this should be run on all of the test/training data.  Prediction:
this will take a while.
